Portfolio Website Ver 4

Hello visitor, my name is Sharanya Banerjee. I am a graduate student at Arizona State University, Tempe and a Network Operations Engineer in Devops at Lumen Technolgies, Tempe. This is the repository to my portfolio website. It has been made using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS. 
I frequently update this repository with fresh ideas that come to my head. 

Thanks for visiting. Cheers!
