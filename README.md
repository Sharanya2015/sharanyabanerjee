Portfolio Website Ver 1

Hello viewer, my name is Sharanya Banerjee. I am a graduate student at Arizona State University, Tempe. 
This is the repository to my portfolio website. It has been made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. 
I frequently update this repository with fresh ideas that come to my head. I plan on adding Jeykll plugins to this website in the upcoming version. 

Thanks for visiting. Cheers!
